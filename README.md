# Introduction:

This repository contains code for solving the phase-field simulation benchmark problem using both CPU and GPU implementations. The focus is on optimizing performance on a single computational unit through various strategies. It supports data generation and performance comparison between conventional numerical algorithms and machine learning approaches for the phase-field problem.

The results were published in the following paper:

If you find this code helpful or use it to generate phase-field simulation data, please consider citing the paper. It is one of my last several publications before leaving acedamia.
